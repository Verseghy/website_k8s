#!/usr/bin/env bash
# guard-bash.sh: the PreToolUse hook that screens every Bash command an agent
# runs in website_k8s (layer 2 of the guardrails; layer 1 is the deny rules in
# .claude/settings.json, and CLAUDE.md, "Guardrails", describes both).
#
# Why it exists
#   This repository is the GitOps source of the Verseghy clusters (the
#   OpenShift hub and the MicroShift edge), and an agent working in it usually
#   has `oc` access to them. Layer 1 matches command text as written. It misses
#   the same command behind a wrapper (`sh -c '...'`), with another flag order,
#   or inside `oc exec`. This hook reads the whole command, splits it the way a
#   shell would (ANSI-C $'...' quoting decoded), finds oc's verb the way oc's
#   command parser does, also behind options it does not know
#   (`oc --wait ns delete web`), and blocks:
#
#   check 1, dangerous commands anywhere in the command:
#     - kubectl (the clusters are run with oc, and these checks parse oc);
#     - force deletion: a true --force on oc delete or oc replace, whatever
#       the grace period, and a true --force with --grace-period=0 anywhere;
#     - oc delete naming a PVC, PV, Argo CD Application, namespace or project
#       in any spelling (ApplicationSets too, because deleting one deletes its
#       Applications; a namespace or project takes everything in it along),
#       also when the command line runs an `oc get` of one of them and the
#       oc delete takes its resources from another command's output:
#       `oc delete $(oc get pvc -o name)`, `oc get pvc -o name | xargs oc
#       delete`, `oc get pvc -o yaml | oc delete -f -`; and every
#       `oc delete --raw`, which deletes whatever its URI names;
#     - `argocd app delete`, `argocd app delete-resource` and `argocd appset
#       delete`, with any options: through the Argo CD API they delete an
#       Application with every resource it manages, managed resources of any
#       kind, or an ApplicationSet with its Applications; and `argocd app
#       confirm-deletion`, with any options, which releases the deletions that
#       a Prune=confirm or Delete=confirm sync option holds back. argocd counts
#       under its release download names too (`argocd-linux-amd64`);
#     - an `oc patch`, or an `argocd app patch-resource`, whose patch names
#       finalizers, or names a PV's persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy with Delete,
#       Recycle or a value only the shell knows, read as the JSON or YAML
#       decoder reads it, escapes included; or that replaces or removes a
#       whole object or its whole metadata, and with it the finalizers; or
#       that holds a YAML binary tag, a tag with a `%` escape or a %TAG
#       directive, behind which kubectl's YAML decoder decodes text that
#       the hook does not read;
#     - an `argocd app patch` with the same finalizer match, since an
#       Application's finalizers decide what deleting it takes along (the
#       reclaim-policy match does not apply: an Application has none);
#     - an `oc annotate`, an `oc patch` or any argocd command that names
#       Argo CD's deletion-approved annotation: it is what `argocd app
#       confirm-deletion` writes, so setting it another way releases the same
#       deletions; and an inline manifest that names it, which oc apply,
#       oc create or oc replace reads from the command text: a heredoc, a
#       here-string, piped echo or printf text or the echo or printf output
#       of a process substitution;
#     - the data-wiping commands of application CLIs, also inside oc exec,
#       oc rsh or oc debug, where they would wipe a cluster database:
#       Laravel's `artisan migrate:fresh|refresh|reset|rollback` and
#       `artisan db:wipe`, abbreviated too (the backend Deployment is a
#       Laravel app on the edge MySQL), and the `db reset`, `db down`,
#       `db truncate` and `db seed --reset` / `-r` subcommands of any program
#       (the Loco convention);
#     - sea-orm-cli `migrate fresh|refresh|reset|down`, against any database,
#       a local one included, also inside oc exec, oc rsh or oc debug, under
#       both of its program names (`sea-orm-cli` and `sea`) and with migrate's
#       value options read as clap reads them, grouped short options
#       (`-vu URL`) included: this repository has no SeaORM project, and a
#       database that answers on localhost here may be a cluster's one behind
#       a port-forward opened outside the agent's shell or an ssh tunnel.
#   check 2, the database target of the database commands psql, pg_restore,
#     mysql, mariadb and sea-orm-cli (also as `sea`, when one of sea-orm-cli's
#     commands follows that word): it blocks when the target host is not
#     local (localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1 or a Unix socket) or cannot be checked.
#     Any of them, and the Redis clients redis-cli, redis-benchmark,
#     valkey-cli and keydb-cli, run through oc exec, oc rsh or oc debug (also
#     as a heredoc, a here-string or an echo or printf script piped into
#     them, through any further pipeline stages) runs in the cluster and is
#     always blocked. A Redis client is also blocked as the command of a pod
#     that the agent starts: in the command part of `oc run` (`oc run tmp
#     --image=redis -- redis-cli -h <service> FLUSHALL`), its --overrides
#     JSON and the text it passes to the pod on stdin, in the command part
#     of `oc create job|cronjob|deployment|deploymentconfig`, and in an
#     inline manifest that oc apply, oc create or oc replace reads; a
#     database command there keeps its target check, as before. A Redis
#     client on the agent's own host is not checked: the clusters' Redis
#     answers there only through a port-forward, which this check blocks.
#     Only the command part of oc exec, oc rsh, oc debug, oc run or oc
#     create counts: for exec and debug the words after `--`, or else the
#     words after the target; for run and create the positional words after
#     the pod's name, before `--` and after it (`oc run tmp --image=redis
#     --command redis-cli -- -h <service> FLUSHALL` runs redis-cli); for
#     rsh the words after the pod, the program its --shell names, and with
#     -f every word. So a pod, container, namespace or image named like a
#     client (`oc exec deploy/mysql -- df -h`, `oc run redis-cli
#     --image=redis -- redis-server`) is not blocked by its name, nor is a
#     data path such as /var/lib/mysql. A pod looked up with an unquoted
#     $(...) or `...` does not end the command part (`oc exec $(oc get pod
#     -o name) -- psql` is blocked). It also blocks an
#     `oc port-forward` to a PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB or Redis port (also
#     written with a leading `+`), because the forwarded database then answers
#     on localhost, which this check would otherwise take for a local one. No
#     Redis client is a listed command, so a forwarded Redis (backend2's, for
#     example) would answer on localhost with no check at all.
#
#   website_k8s has no code-level database guard, so this hook and human
#   review are what stand between an agent and a destructive cluster
#   operation. The hook is a second line of defence against agent mistakes,
#   not a security boundary: commands that come from files or scripts are not
#   visible to it (`oc exec -i pod -- sh < script.sh`, `oc delete -f
#   list.txt`, `oc patch --patch-file p.json`), and neither is text that only
#   a shell run computes, because the hook reads the command and does not run
#   it: a variable's value (`P=psql; oc exec pod -- $P`), printf formats and
#   echo -e escapes, brace expansion (`deletion-appro{v,}ed`), globs, or
#   decoded output (`base64 -d`). (The output of an echo or printf that a
#   shell runs is read, see lex, and so are the escapes of $'...' quoting,
#   see ansi_c_text; a substitution that fills in only part of the command
#   name, `o$(echo c) delete ...`, or a double-quoted one with double quotes
#   inside, is not, and each echo or printf output is read as a line of its
#   own, also where bash prints it on one line, `printf oc; echo ' delete
#   ...'`.) Text that xargs or parallel pass to a program that fed_programs
#   does not list is not read as its arguments either, so a `db` subcommand
#   passed that way is not checked (`echo reset | xargs app-cli db`). Some
#   routes are not checked at all: an `oc replace`, `oc apply` or `oc edit`
#   that drops finalizers, replaces an object or sets a reclaim policy, an
#   inline manifest that does so included, and `oc replace --raw`;
#   `argocd app sync --prune` and `argocd app set --auto-prune`; an ssh
#   tunnel to a database (`ssh -L 15432:<db>:5432 <host>`); file commands in
#   a pod (`oc exec <pod> -- rm -rf /var/lib/mysql`); commands that an
#   interpreter runs (`python3 -c '...'`); and output redirected into a
#   process substitution (`echo '...' > >(bash)`). These stay gaps too: a
#   manifest in a file, in another command's output or in an editor (`oc
#   apply -f job.yaml`, `oc edit`, `argocd app edit`); a Redis client
#   patched into an existing pod spec (`oc patch deploy ...` that sets a
#   container's command, `oc set probe ... -- redis-cli`); a raw socket or
#   any other program that speaks the Redis protocol (`nc`); a pod started
#   from an image whose entrypoint is a Redis client, which gets only
#   arguments (`oc run tmp --image=<client image> -- -h <service>
#   FLUSHALL`), because an image's name does not count; paths outside the
#   verbs that the pod checks read (`oc adm must-gather --image=... --
#   <command>`, `argocd app create -f -`, and the text that `oc attach -i`
#   passes to a container that is already running); and two spellings these
#   readings miss (a cat here-string inside a group, a heredoc in a group
#   that does not close on the line after its body). CLAUDE.md lists the
#   paths that neither layer covers.
#
# Origin
#   Adapted from Verseghy/website_backend3's .claude/hooks/guard-bash.sh, first
#   from its commit 4e7fb76 and since brought up to its commit 3524b54 and
#   to its next two guard hook changes: the first blocks redis-cli in the
#   cluster, Argo CD's patch-resource patches and its deletion approvals; the
#   second blocks Redis clients in the pods an agent starts and in inline
#   manifests, `argocd app patch` of finalizers and inline manifests that
#   name the deletion-approved annotation, and reads heredocs on every line.
#   Licence: that repository is AGPL-3.0-only; the original's only human

#
# Contract with Claude Code (verified against the "Hooks reference" of the
# Claude Code docs, 2026-10-26)
#   - stdin is one JSON object; the Bash command is at .tool_input.command and
#     the tool name at .tool_name;
#   - exit 0 lets the command run;
#   - exit 2 blocks it, and stderr is shown to the agent as the reason, so every
#     message says what was refused and what to do instead;
#   - any other exit code is a failure. .claude/settings.json sets
#     "onFailure": "block" on this hook (Claude Code v2.1.295 or later), so a
#     failure, a hook that cannot start or one that reaches its timeout blocks
#     the command too. Without it a failure would be NON-blocking, and an older
#     client ignores the field, so every failure path below still exits 2
#     itself (fail closed): a missing jq, unreadable input, or an unexpected
#     error in this script.
#   .claude/settings.json runs it in exec form: "command" is
#   "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/guard-bash.sh" with "args": [], so no
#   shell is involved and Claude Code substitutes the placeholder as a plain
#   string; a project path with spaces needs no quoting. It still exports
#   CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR to the hook process. The script itself is the command,
#   not `bash` with the script in "args": a client that predates "args" runs
#   "command" in shell form, which still starts the hook, while a bare `bash`
#   would read the hook's JSON input as a script.
#
# Design notes
#   - It runs before every Bash call, so it must be fast: it starts one jq
#     process, and jq returns "allow" at once for any command that contains
#     neither a trigger word (kubectl, oc, db, artisan, psql, redis-cli,
#     argocd, ...) nor one of the variables check 2 reads. Typical commands
#     take a few tens of milliseconds; long ones, and long text that is split
#     again as commands, are cut into chunks first (see `chunks`), the lexer
#     keeps what it needs about a segment's earlier words in flags, and each
#     segment sees only the assignments in scope for it, so the work grows
#     linearly with the length of the command. (One exception is bounded in
#     the tests: a patch line full of YAML comments, see yaml_comment_re.)
#   - The policy is a jq program embedded below, so the hook depends only on
#     bash and jq. jq's regular expressions do the tokenising in C. jq reads
#     it from a process substitution, because it is longer than one
#     command-line argument may be on Linux (128 KiB).
#   - Shell parsing is approximated, deliberately erring towards blocking. A
#     word is parsed again as a command only where a shell would run it (the
#     command string of -c, also after `--` or other options; the arguments of
#     eval, ssh and watch; a here-string read by a shell; echo or printf
#     output piped into a shell or into oc exec, oc rsh or oc debug, or in a
#     substitution whose output the shell runs; and $(...) inside double
#     quotes), and a heredoc body counts as a script only
#     when a shell reads it (the receiver is matched with quotes and
#     backslashes removed, and a variable as the receiver counts as a shell),
#     so commit messages and files that merely mention a command are not
#     blocked. A heredoc is found on every line, after any `<`, and inside
#     the scripts above; a `<<` that may stand inside quotes makes the hook
#     read the command twice, once with it as a heredoc and once as text
#     (see heredoc_texts), so a quoted `<<WORD` cannot hide the commands
#     after it. Its delimiter is the word after the `<<` as bash reads it
#     (`<<\EOF`, `<<'@@'`, `<<E"O"F` and `<<'END OF'` included, see
#     heredoc_operators); one whose line never comes ends at the end of the
#     text, as in bash; and one the hook cannot know (`<<$(...)`, a quote
#     that does not close on the line) makes it read the rest of the text
#     both as the body and as commands. The cases it handles are pinned by
#     scripts/tests/test-guard-bash.sh, which must pass before this file
#     changes (it runs in the CI "check" job, .github/workflows/ci.yaml).
#   - It is deliberately stricter than the programs it checks:
#       - check 2 checks every explicit target source that is present (inline
#         variables, options and connection strings), not only the first one
#         the client would use (psql prefers -h over PGHOST), so a local value
#         can never hide a remote one; an environment variable is checked
#         unless the client does not use it (see db_targets);
#       - it also reads PGHOSTADDR (libpq connects to it even when a host
#         name is given) and treats a PGSERVICE or service= entry as not
#         checkable;
#       - a true --force on oc delete or oc replace is blocked even without
#         --grace-period=0, because kubectl then sets the grace period to 0;
#       - an ApplicationSet counts like an Application, because deleting one
#         deletes its Applications;
#       - heredocs read by a shell, here-strings, and echo or printf output
#         piped into a shell (also through further pipeline stages and across
#         a line break after |) are checked like `sh -c`, because they run
#         the same commands; a heredoc that only data reads, such as a commit
#         message, is skipped;
#       - an oc delete whose resources come from another command's output
#         ($(...), a variable, xargs, `-f -` or a process substitution) counts
#         as naming a protected kind when the same command line runs an
#         `oc get` of one, because the hook cannot read that output;
#       - text that oc exec, oc rsh or oc debug reads on stdin (a heredoc, a
#         here-string or piped echo or printf output) counts as a script that
#         runs in the cluster, even when the command in the pod is not a
#         shell, because that program may hand its input to a shell. Under
#         xargs the text becomes the oc command's arguments instead, as xargs
#         passes it;
#       - every oc patch or argocd app patch-resource that names finalizers
#         counts, additions included, and `argocd app delete-resource` counts
#         for every kind, because the hook cannot tell the harmless cases
#         apart in the command text; so does every strategic merge
#         `$patch: replace`, `$patch: delete` or `$retainKeys` in such a
#         patch, wherever in the patch it stands, every `path` set to a YAML
#         block scalar, an alias or a tag whose value starts on the next
#         line, and every `oc delete --raw`;
#       - a patch's escapes are decoded where an escaped backslash stands
#         before them too (`\\u0066inalizers`), because no word the checks
#         match holds a backslash (see decoded_text);
#       - any word that names the deletion-approved annotation counts in an
#         oc annotate, an oc patch or any argocd command, also one that only
#         prints it and one in which argocd is only an argument (`grep -rn
#         argocd docs/deletion-approved.md`), and argocd counts under any
#         name that starts with `argocd-`, `argocd_` or `argocd.`;
#       - oc's verb is read in two ways, the hook's and cobra's (see
#         oc_verb_indices), and each verb's words with and without the words
#         before it, and every reading counts; argocd's subcommands are found
#         the way cobra finds them too (see argocd_subcommands), so an option
#         before them, a verb-local one included (`oc -p '<patch>' patch
#         ...`), cannot hide them;
#       - a substitution after a runner word counts as the command name, also
#         after that runner's own options (`sudo -u root $(echo oc) ...`, see
#         is_command_place);
#       - echo or printf output in a process substitution counts as a script
#         whenever a shell, `source` or `.` gets it, even as an argument of a
#         script (`bash run.sh <(echo ...)`);
#       - every word after `artisan` that is not an option counts as its
#         command name, so `php artisan help migrate:fresh` is blocked too;
#       - a sea-orm-cli wipe subcommand counts whatever options follow it, so
#         `sea-orm-cli migrate fresh --help` is blocked too;
#       - an inline manifest, the --overrides JSON of oc run and the text
#         that oc run passes to its pod count when they name a Redis client
#         anywhere as a word (a label, an environment value or a comment
#         too, see redis_client_in_text), and an inline manifest counts when
#         it names the deletion-approved key, a --dry-run=server one
#         included; every text on the stdin of oc apply, oc create or
#         oc replace counts as a manifest, whatever its -f says, as every
#         text that oc exec gets counts as a script;
#       - the receiving line of a heredoc is read with its quotes removed, so
#         a commit, PR or issue title that names oc run, oc apply, oc create
#         or oc replace makes the body after it count as the pod's stdin or
#         as a manifest, and a `<<` that the quoting model is not sure of
#         makes the hook read the command twice (see heredoc_texts), so a
#         body after it is read as commands too; and a `<<` whose
#         delimiter line never comes runs to the end of the text in the
#         reading that takes every operator, unless the model knows it to
#         be text, so `oc exec pod -- echo $((1<<$n))` makes the lines
#         after it the stdin script of that oc exec;
#       - an option value with blanks of oc run or oc create can shift the
#         pod's name in the reading of the words cut at blanks, so
#         `oc run --env 'X=a b' redis-cli --image=redis` is blocked.
#   - It reads DATABASE_URL, PGHOST, PGHOSTADDR, PGSERVICE and MYSQL_HOST
#     from its own environment (the one Claude Code passes to hooks) for the
#     "environment" target source of check 2. That is deliberate: the hook is
#     a process-boundary check whose whole point is to see the environment a
#     command inherits, so it cannot take that environment as an argument.

#     environment changes. Without `--`, which oc 4.22 refuses for exec
#     ("exec [POD] [COMMAND] is not supported anymore") but older clients ran,
#     every word after the target counts.
#   - rsh stops reading its own options at the target (SetInterspersed(false)),
#     so the command is every word after the target, options included; with
#     `--` before the target, the target is the first word after `--`. Its
#     --shell names the program it starts when no command follows, so that
#     value counts too. With -f the target comes from the file, and every
#     positional word is the command (rsh.go: `o.Command = args[0:]`).
#   - run, whose first positional word is the name of the pod it starts,
#     reads its options interspersed, and gives every positional
#     word after the name to the container as its arguments, or with
#     --command as its command (k8s.io/kubectl pkg/cmd/run: `params["args"]
#     = args[1:]`). cobra drops the `--` from those words and keeps the
#     ones before it, and run checks where the `--` stood only to refuse
#     one right after `run` ("NAME is required for run"), so the command
#     part is every positional word after the name before `--` and every
#     word after it: `oc run tmp --image=redis --command redis-cli -- -h
#     <service> FLUSHALL` runs redis-cli, and so does `oc run tmp
#     --image=redis redis-cli -- ...`, because the image's entrypoint runs
#     a first argument that is not an option as the command. An image
#     named like a client (`--image redis-cli`) is not one, and neither is
#     the pod's own name (`oc run redis-cli --image=redis -- redis-server`).
#     The create subcommands that start pods are read the same way (see
#     in_cluster_parts); they refuse a second word before `--` ("exactly

# subshell group. Redirections are dropped. An unquoted $(...), `...` or
# process substitution <(...) is lexed as segments of its own, and the
# segment around it goes on after it with a placeholder word in its place
# (see lex_chunk). When the shell runs the output of such a substitution as
# commands, and it is echo or printf output, that text is split as commands
# too (see substitution_use).
# Quotes and backslashes are removed from each word the way the shell joins
# them; a $'...' part has its escapes decoded (see ansi_c_text), and a $"..."
# part counts as double-quoted. A quoted string that the shell would run as a
# command (after `-c`, `--command`, `eval`, `ssh` or `watch`, and every $(...)
# or `...` inside double quotes) is split again into segments of its own,
# recursively.

# One token per match. Capture groups, in order: [comment, redirection,
# separator, word]. Quotes and escapes stay inside the word for word_text. A

#
# A heredoc is found on its receiving line, the line that holds the `<<`
# operator; its body is the lines after that line, up to a line that holds
# only the delimiter (blanks around it allowed, which ends a body early only
# where a `<<-` would, and errs towards reading more text as commands), or
# to the end of the text when no such line comes (see strip_heredocs). A
# `<<` inside quotes is no operator: `echo '<<X'` prints <<X, and the lines
# after it are commands. The hook reads every command twice where that is
# not sure (see heredoc_texts), and these patterns tell where it is sure: a
# small model of bash's quoting, line by line. It knows single and double
# quotes, a $(...) with plain content and simple strings, the parts of a
# line where bash reads a `<<` as a shift or as text (see
# heredoc_expansion_re), `$` before anything else, and a comment that starts
# a word; a line with anything it does not model (a backslash, a backtick,
# $'...', a nested or unbalanced $(...), an unclosed `((`, `${` or `$[`)
# makes the quoting "unknown" from there on. The patterns use possessive
# loops, and each item starts at a different character (or at the same one
# with a different next character), so each line is read once.

# expands those even in data), so a commit message or a file written with
# `cat <<'EOF'` cannot trip check 1. A body that oc exec, oc rsh or oc debug
# reads is kept as the -c script of a synthetic `oc <verb> stdin -- sh -c
# '<body>'` line (see in_cluster_script), so that check 2 sees the database
# commands in it next to the oc that runs them in the cluster. lex does the
# same for here-strings and piped echo or printf text. Three more receivers
# are read in addition to the above:
#   - oc run: the body is the text the pod gets, kept as a synthetic
#     "pod-stdin" segment for check 2's Redis client rule (see
#     synthetic_marker), and not as commands, since the pod's program need
#     not be a shell (a shell receiver keeps it as a script, as before);
#   - oc apply, oc create or oc replace: the body is an inline manifest, kept
#     as a synthetic "manifest" segment;
#   - xargs or GNU parallel: the body is also put on the receiving line as a
#     here-string, in place of the heredoc, which lex passes on as their
#     input (and cat passes on as its output, see cat_here_strings), so that
#     `xargs oc <<'EOF'` with `delete ns web` in the body reads as `xargs oc
#     delete ns web`.
# The receivers are found on the line with its operators taken out, in each
# reading of unquoted_texts, also with the separators inside quoted strings
# blanked (see quoted_separators_blanked). Every receiver on the line reads
# every body on it, which errs towards blocking: bash gives a command the
# last of its heredocs (`oc apply -f - <<'A' <<'B'` reads B) and each
# command its own. When the pipeline goes on after the bodies, because the
# line ends in `|` or `|&` (`cat <<'EOF' |`, the body, `EOF`, then `oc apply
# -f -`), or when $next closes a group (`( cat <<'EOF'`, the body, `EOF`,
# then `) | oc apply -f -`), $next is part of the receiving text too, since
# its command reads what the receiving line prints. The result is

# each after a line break, and whether $next is part of the receiving text.

# Every operator on a line counts, in order, each taking the lines up to its
# delimiter. One whose delimiter never comes takes the rest of the text, as
# bash does: it ends such a heredoc at the end of the input with only a
# warning, and still feeds the body to its command (also under eval, which
# runs the Bash tool's commands), so `oc exec -i redis-0 -- sh <<'EOF'` and
# `redis-cli FLUSHALL` with no `EOF` line run the client in the cluster.
# Before, such an operator was no heredoc and its body was read as host
# commands, where a Redis client is not checked. A `<<` that is no operator
# in bash (`$((1<<2))`, `echo 'a <<b'`) then hides the rest of the text in
# this reading only: the reading with $aware never takes an operator that
# the quoting model is not sure of, so the rest stays command text there.
# An open operator (see heredoc_operators), whose delimiter the hook does not
# know, takes the rest of the text as its body too, but leaves those lines
# to be read as commands as well, because bash may end its body on any of
# them; that errs towards blocking both ways. A heredoc counts on every line
# of the command, also after a `<` (`oc apply -f <(cat <<'EOF'`): before, a
# pattern anchored with jq's `^`, which matches
# only at the start of the whole text, found one only on the first line,
# and only before any `<` there, so a script that oc exec read on a later
# line (`echo hi`, then `oc exec -i pg-0 -- sh <<'EOF'` and `psql`) ran on
# the host for the checks.

#     other program, the text stays data;
#   - a here-string of a `cat` in a pipeline, which reaches the next stage
#     as piped echo text does (see cat_here_strings);
#   - the same text read by an oc run, which it passes to the pod it
#     starts, or by an oc apply, oc create or oc replace, which reads it as
#     an inline manifest, and the echo or printf output of a process
#     substitution that one of the latter reads as its file: each is kept
#     as a synthetic segment (see synthetic_marker), not split as commands;
#   - the echo or printf output of an unquoted substitution that the shell
#     runs (see substitution_use): a process substitution that a shell,

# applies `-p` text in either), and both decoders turn an escape in a quoted
# string into its character: JSON's \uXXXX, and YAML's \xXX, \uXXXX and
# \UXXXXXXXX. So `"fin\u0061lizers"` is finalizers and
# `"argocd.argoproj.io/deletion-\x61pproved"` is the annotation's key. Only
# escapes of ASCII characters are decoded, because every word matched is
# ASCII. JSON's `\/` is a `/` (RFC 8259 section 7): the API
# server's JSON decoder reads it so in a patch that reaches it as written,
# as Argo CD sends patch-resource's --patch (`"path":"\/metadata"` replaces
# the whole metadata) and kubectl a patch that starts with `{`. kubectl's
# YAML decoder (go-yaml v2), which reads every other `-p` patch, refuses
# it, so there it only errs towards blocking. YAML's escaped line break
# inside a double-quoted string (a `\` before a line break: LF, CR LF, CR,
# or the NEL, LS or PS that go-yaml v2 reads as one too; the next line's
# indentation dropped) joins a word across lines, so it is removed with that
# indentation. The lexer removes a `\` and an LF as a shell line
# continuation before this, also inside single quotes, where the shell keeps
# them, and leaves the next line's indentation in the word, which the
# callers drop (see without_spaces and without_blanks); so this matters for
# the other line breaks and for one that a $'...' part decodes
# (`$'final\\\n  izers'`). Splitting at each backslash keeps the cost linear
# in the length of the word (a gsub would be quadratic, see `chunks`). An
# escaped backslash (`\\u0061`) is decoded as if it were not escaped, which
# errs towards blocking: no word the checks match holds a backslash, so

#     finalizer). A merge patch that sets the list, a JSON patch `remove` and
#     a strategic merge $deleteFromPrimitiveList each remove some, and the
#     hook cannot tell all of them from an addition, so it matches every
#     patch that names finalizers, additions included;
#   - it sets a PV's reclaim policy to Delete, which deletes the volume with
#     its claim, or to the deprecated Recycle, which wipes the volume's
#     data (`rm -rf /thevolume/*`) when its claim is released: it names
#     persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy and, in the same word, Delete, Recycle or
#     a shell expansion, whose value cannot be checked. Setting Retain stays
#     allowed. Other values are not matched;
#   - it replaces or removes a whole object or its whole metadata, and with
#     it the finalizers, without naming them (see whole_metadata_patch_re);
#   - it holds a YAML tag whose decoded text the hook does not read (see
#     yaml_opaque_tag_re), which may name any of these. Like a tag with no
#     value, it counts only as written, because a tag holds no blank.
# The word is read as the patch decoder reads it (see decoded_text), so an
# escape such as fin\u0061lizers counts too, both as it is and with its
# spaces and tabs removed (see without_spaces): a key folded across lines
# counts only without them, and the whole-metadata rule needs the blank or
# line break that ends a YAML value (`path: /metadata` before the next key),
# which the second reading keeps. A tag with no value counts only as written
# (see tag_only_path_re).
#   $reclaim - whether the reclaim-policy match applies. It does for oc patch

# (docs/user-guide/sync-options.md). So it blocks:
#   - an `oc annotate` or `oc patch` that names it in any word after `oc`,
#     whatever the resource and whatever the value, its removal (`KEY-`)
#     included, as the patch rule matches finalizer additions too;
#   - any argocd command that names it. `argocd app patch` and `argocd app
#     patch-resource` write it with their --patch, and `argocd app create
#     --upsert` merges its --annotations into an existing Application
#     (server/application/application.go, updateApp with merge). The hook
#     does not tell these from an argocd command that only prints such a

# jq reads the hook input from this script's stdin. A parse error or an empty
# input fails closed. The program goes in as a file that a process
# substitution fills, not as an argument: Linux limits one argument to 128
# KiB (MAX_ARG_STRLEN), and the commented program is longer than that, so
# `jq -r "$GUARD_JQ"` would fail with "Argument list too long" and block
# every command. printf is a bash builtin, so no exec limit applies to it,
# and the substitution is a pipe, so unlike a here-string of this size it
# needs no temporary file. A /dev/fd path that cannot be opened
# makes jq fail, which blocks too.

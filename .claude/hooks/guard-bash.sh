#!/usr/bin/env bash
# guard-bash.sh: the PreToolUse hook that screens every Bash command an agent
# runs in website_k8s (layer 2 of the guardrails that website_backend3's
# ADR 0024 section 4 defines; its "Scope of the guardrails" gives website_k8s
# the same hook, without the cargo commands in check 2).
#
# Why it exists
#   This repository is the GitOps source of the Verseghy clusters, and an agent
#   working in it usually has `oc` access to them. Layer 1, the deny rules in
#   .claude/settings.json, matches command text as written. It misses the same
#   command behind a wrapper (`sh -c '...'`), with another flag order, or inside
#   `oc exec`. This hook reads the whole command, splits it the way a shell
#   would, and blocks:
#
#   check 1, dangerous commands anywhere in the command (unchanged from
#   website_backend3):
#     - kubectl (Verseghy uses oc, never kubectl);
#     - force deletion: a true --force on oc delete or oc replace, whatever
#       the grace period, and a true --force with --grace-period=0 anywhere;
#     - oc delete naming a PVC, PV or Argo CD Application in any spelling
#       (ApplicationSets too, because deleting one deletes its Applications);
#     - Loco's data-wiping subcommands `db reset`, `db down`, `db truncate`
#       and `db seed --reset` / `-r` of any binary: cargo loco, the app binary
#       backend3-cli, or inside oc exec / oc rsh / oc debug;
#     - sea-orm-cli `migrate fresh|refresh|reset|down`.
#   check 2, the database target of database-touching commands (psql,
#     pg_restore, mysql, sea-orm-cli): it blocks when the target host is not
#     local (localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1 or a Unix socket) or cannot be checked.
#     Any of them run through oc exec, oc rsh or oc debug (also as a heredoc,
#     here-string or piped script) runs in the cluster and is always blocked.
#     ADR 0024 leaves the cargo commands (cargo loco, cargo run, cargo test,
#     cargo nextest) and with them the importer-source check
#     (IMPORT_SOURCE_DATABASE_URL, read only for cargo commands) out of check 2
#     here: website_k8s holds no Rust code, and website_backend3 checks its
#     cargo commands with its own copy of this hook and its load_config guard.
#
#   website_k8s has no layer 3 (website_backend3's code-level database guard),
#   so this hook and human review are what stand between an agent and a
#   destructive cluster operation. The hook is a second line of defence against
#   agent mistakes, not a security boundary: commands that come from files (for
#   example `oc delete -f`) or from scripts are not visible to it, and neither
#   are resource names that another command produces (`oc delete $(oc get pvc
#   -o name)`, `oc get pvc -o name | xargs oc delete`). CLAUDE.md lists the
#   paths that neither layer covers.
#
# Origin
#   Adapted from website_backend3@4e7fb76:.claude/hooks/guard-bash.sh. The
#   parser and check 1 are unchanged; check 2 drops the cargo commands and the
#   importer-source check; the messages point at this repository and at the
#   public ADR. A fix to the shared parser or to check 1 belongs in both copies.
#   Licence: website_backend3 is AGPL-3.0-only, and its ADR 0012 lets its code
#   move into an MPL-2.0 repository only if its authors relicense it. The
#   original's only human author is a maintainer of both repositories and, by
#   merging this adaptation here, licenses it under website_k8s's MPL-2.0

#
# Contract with Claude Code (verified against the "Hooks reference" of the
# Claude Code docs, 2026-10-25)
#   - stdin is one JSON object; the Bash command is at .tool_input.command and
#     the tool name at .tool_name;
#   - exit 0 lets the command run;
#   - exit 2 blocks it, and stderr is shown to the agent as the reason, so every
#     message says what was refused and what to do instead;
#   - any other exit code is a NON-blocking error and the command would still
#     run. That is why every failure path below exits 2 (fail closed): a
#     missing jq, unreadable input, or an unexpected error in this script.
#   .claude/settings.json runs it as "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"/.claude/hooks/guard-bash.sh
#   (shell form, run with `sh -c`; Claude Code exports CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR to the
#   hook process).
#
# Design notes
#   - It runs before every Bash call, so it must be fast: it starts one jq
#     process, and jq returns "allow" at once for any command that contains
#     neither a trigger word (kubectl, oc, db, psql, ...) nor one of the
#     variables check 2 reads. Typical commands take a few tens of
#     milliseconds; long ones are cut into chunks first (see `chunks`), and
#     each segment sees only the assignments in scope for it, so the work
#     grows linearly with the length of the command.
#   - The policy is a jq program embedded below, so the hook depends only on
#     bash and jq. jq's regular expressions do the tokenising in C.
#   - Shell parsing is approximated, deliberately erring towards blocking. A
#     word is parsed again as a command only where a shell would run it (the
#     command string of -c, also after `--` or other options; the arguments of
#     eval, ssh and watch; a here-string read by a shell; echo or printf
#     output piped into a shell; and $(...) inside double quotes), and a
#     heredoc body counts as a script only when a shell reads it (the
#     receiver is matched with quotes and backslashes removed, and a variable
#     as the receiver counts as a shell), so commit messages and files that
#     merely mention a command are not blocked. The cases it handles are
#     pinned by scripts/tests/test-guard-bash.sh, which must pass before this
#     file changes (it runs in the CI "check" job, .github/workflows/ci.yaml).
#   - check_in_cluster looks for a database command in every word after
#     `oc exec|rsh|debug`, the pod or workload included, so
#     `oc exec deploy/mysql -- df -h` is blocked too. That false positive is
#     inherited from website_backend3 and fails safe; until both copies are
#     fixed, name the pod instead (`oc exec pod/mysql-<suffix> -- ...`).
#   - Where ADR 0024 leaves room, it is stricter, exactly as website_backend3's
#     copy is:
#       - check 2 checks every explicit target source that is present (inline
#         variables, options and connection strings), not only the first,
#         because psql prefers -h over PGHOST; an environment variable is
#         checked unless the command does not use it (see db_targets), so a
#         local inline PGHOST cannot hide a remote DATABASE_URL;
#       - it also reads PGHOSTADDR (libpq and sqlx use it) and treats a
#         PGSERVICE or service= entry as not checkable;
#       - a true --force on oc delete or oc replace is blocked even without
#         --grace-period=0, because kubectl then sets the grace period to 0;
#       - an ApplicationSet counts like an Application, because deleting one
#         deletes its Applications.
#   - It reads DATABASE_URL, PGHOST, PGHOSTADDR, PGSERVICE and MYSQL_HOST
#     from its own environment (the one Claude Code passes to hooks) for the
#     "environment" target source of check 2. That is deliberate: the hook is
#     a process-boundary check whose whole point is to see the environment a
#     command inherits, so it cannot take that environment as an argument.
#
# Usage (for tests and manual checks)
